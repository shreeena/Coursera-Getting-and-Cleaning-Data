## Getting and Cleaning Data

This is my work for the course project. 

The script, running_analysis.R, first downloads and unzips the data set. It reads the training and test data sets and formats all the variable names before merging the two sets of data. 


After merging both sets of data, we extract the columns of data containing mean and standard deviation.

The script then creates a tidy data set, tidy.txt, that contains the means of each test subject for each activity and variable. 

Please refer to the codebook for more information on the data and variables.
